# Refactoring Horiseon's Code

## Description

This code was written for the purpose of refactoring the HTML and CSS of Horiseon Marketing Solutions. This was done by consolidating unnecessarily repeated code and improving the existing code's descriptiveness by replacing divs with more specific semantic elements. By doing this, the accesibility of Horiseon's HTML and CSS was improved.
